-Give the build option a default setting
-Document the options for build
-Better ways to roll for things (we don't want complex lines)
-Rephrase building construction that refers to "wood"
-Construct buildings with stone as an option.
-Checking assigned tasks on a person should write the parameter too. That code (checking for parameters) needs to be made cleaner...?
